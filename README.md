# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Journey



This is a [foundational certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) offered by AWS.
I Wanted to be aware of AWS concepts, as these provide infrastructure to build a wide range of IT components across several domains.



### Preparation
Effectively prepared for this exam in less than 4 weeks. After going through several online courses I bought these 2:

[[NEW] Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - 2021 \| Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/)

[Practice Exams \| AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C01 | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/)

Went through the first course atleast thrice, since after completing the first time all the service names were quite confusing. Couldn't really comprehend the functionality offerings to the correct AWS service names too..

While understanding the first time, I ensured to make my own notes. I love One Note for this purpose, since you can paste screenshots and search for text which are in the screenshots too!


While going through the course 2nd & 3rd time, I prepared a table here - [About_All_AWS_Services.pdf](https://github.com/rraghu214/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/blob/main/About_All_AWS_Services.pdf) that you will find in this repo, which contains a one liner of each item explained in this course. This is like a one stop shop to quickly glance for any info.

Despite work schedule I used to spend 3-4 hours on weekdays and close to 8 hours on the 2 weekends.


The 2nd course is a series of practise exams which really strengthened my prep. Overall allocate 1 week to attend these tests as you need to focus on office work as well. Every night after the work spent couple of hours to take up a test. Next morning used to review the incorrect answers. The course provided explanation for every Q - correct & incorrect options too.

After this I went through a few youtube videos & online sources that provide some practise questions just to get a different purview.

Lastly, go through  [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) , not needed to go in depth. But glance the names of all the services. When you click on each of them, it provides a short desciption of the offering. I strongly suggest this since 1 or 2 Qs appeared in the exam which weren't covered in the course or to gauge the options in the Q - sometimes appear as distractors. (Mind you, the course is very comprehenssive and sufficient to get a great score too.) If you are sitll interested, glance through the User-Guide section too.

### The Exam itself!

I booked for the exam the previous day only. Some Qs were descriptive and needed time to understand. However, completed the exam in an hour.
Mostly there were questions on,
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Shared Responsibility Model 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Availability , Elasticity, Agility
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Advantages of cloud
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 2-3 Qs on design principle of Well Architected Framework
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 2-3 Qs on Database
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - No Qs were there on SNS, SQS
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Couple of topics that were not in the course - Neptune & AWS Outposts.
